## Data Result

The dataset of this work can be accessed via the Zenodo link [here](https://zenodo.org/record/8252997). The zip file contains all the raw data as reported in the paper; most of the structures are self-explained but we wish to highlight the following:

* The data under the folder `1.0-0.0` and `0.0-1.0` are for the single-objective optimizers, including IRACE, GA, RS, ParamILS, FLASH, BOCA, and SMAC. The former uses the first objective as the target performance objective while the latter uses the second objective as the target.

* The data in the folder `none` under the folders named by the subject systems are for PMO.

* The data in the folder `linear` which is under the folders named by the subject systems are for the AdMMO and MMO. In particular:

  * The data under the folder `0.0` are for AdMMO (30% proportion).
  * The data under the folder `1.0` are for MMO.
  * The result under the folder `0.0-x`, where x is a certain number for AdMMO under x% of the proportion.
  * The data under the folder `0.0-wodup` are for the variant of AdMMO that indistinguishes duplicate configurations.
  * The data under the folder `0.0-removedup` are for the variant of AdMMO that simply removes all but one duplicate. 
  * The data under the folder `0.0-wotrigger` are for the variant of AdMMO that does not use a progressive trigger

* For those data of AdMMO, MMO, and PMO, the folder `0` and `1` denote using uses the first and second objectives as the target performance objective, respectively.

* In the lowest-level folder where the data is stored (i.e., the `sas` folder), `SolutionSet.rtf` contains the results over all repeated runs; `SolutionSetWithMeasurement.rtf` records the results over different numbers of measurements.

## Souce Code

The [`code`](https://github.com/3c23/admmo/tree/main/code) folder contains all the information about the source code, as well as a library jar file in the [`library`](https://github.com/3c23/admmo/tree/main/library) folder. The core of AdMMO is implemented in the `AdMMONSGAII.java` class, but due to it using some libraries that may violate the double-blind requirement, we temporarily hide some of the code import those packages.

## Running Code

Running the code requires a few steps depending on the RQs. For all those steps, both the jars files in the `library` folders need to be imported and compiled together. There are a few variables that need to change in the `AutoRun.java` class (which is the main class to run the experiments):

* The variable `weights` indicates which is the target performance objective for the single objective optimizer, 1.0-0.0 means the first objective while 0.0-1.0 means the second objective.
* The variable `single_algs` controls which single objective optimizer to run: irace, ga, paramils, or rs.
* The variable `benchmark` describes which system to run, currently, it can take the following values:
  * mariadb
  * storm
  * vp9
  * keras
  * mongodb
  * x264
  * llvm
* The variable `index` indicates which is the target objective, 0 means the first objective while 1 means the second objective.
* The variable `w_a` controls whether it is AdMMO or MMO: 0.0 is for AdMMO while 1.0 is for MMO.
* The variable `flash` controls whether we run different variants of AdMMO.

The `prefix_path` variable in the `Parser.java` class would also need to be changed to correctly reflect which system to run, using the path to the data source in the [`measured-data`](https://github.com/3c23/admmo/tree/main/measured-data) folder. 

### RQ1 and RQ2

* Running function `so` would produce results for single-objective optimizers.
* Running function `pmo` would produce results for PMO.
* Running function `mo` would produce results for AdMMO or MMO (controlled by the `w_a` variable).
* Running function `flash_so` would produce results for FLASH
* Running function `boca_so` would produce results for BOCA.
* Running function `smac_so` would produce results for SMAC.

### RQ3

* Running function `mo` would produce results for the variants of AdMMO (controlled by the `flash` variable) and by setting `SASAlgorithmAdaptor.isAdaptConstantly = false` or `SASAlgorithmAdaptor.isToFilterRedundantSolution = false`.

### RQ4

* Running function `mo` would produce results for the variants of AdMMO (controlled by the `flash` variable) and by setting the variable `p` or in the `AdMMONSGAII.java` class.
